    "### What is a probability model?\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to answer: **given a shot, what's the probability it becomes a goal?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can't use regular linear regression for this because probabilities must stay between 0 and 1 — linear regression has no such constraint. That's where **logistic regression** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Sigmoid Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression applies a **sigmoid function** to a linear equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{goal}) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ...)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking this down:\n",
    "- $x_1, x_2, ...$ are your **features** (distance, angle, technique)\n",
    "- $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, ...$ are **coefficients** the model learns from data\n",
    "- The sigmoid function squishes any number into a value between 0 and 1\n",
    "- The output is a **probability** — e.g. 0.73 means 73% chance of a goal\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the model \"learn\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Training means finding the $\\beta$ values that make the model's predictions match reality as closely as possible. It does this by minimizing **log loss** (also called binary cross-entropy):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Log Loss} = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ y_i \\log(\\hat{p}_i) + (1 - y_i) \\log(1 - \\hat{p}_i) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $y_i = 1$ if the shot was a goal, $0$ if not\n",
    "- $\\hat{p}_i$ is the model's predicted probability\n",
    "- The model adjusts $\\beta$ values to minimize this loss\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intuition:** If the model says a shot has a 90% chance of being a goal and it actually IS a goal, log loss is low (good). If the model says 90% chance and it's NOT a goal, log loss is high (bad). The model learns to be well-calibrated.\n",

    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Distance to goal | Closer shots score more often |\n",
    "| Shot angle | Wider angles are harder |\n",
    "| Technique (header vs foot) | Headers convert at ~60% the rate of foot shots |\n",

    "### Train/Test Split — Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "We split data into **training** (80%) and **testing** (20%) sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training set**: The model sees these shots and learns from them\n",
    "- **Test set**: The model has never seen these — we use them to measure real performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Without this split, you'd be measuring how well the model memorized your data, not how well it generalizes. A model that only works on data it's already seen is useless in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is sensitive to feature scale. Distance ranges from 0–60, angle from 0–90. We use `StandardScaler` to normalize them to a common scale (mean=0, std=1) so no single feature dominates just because its numbers are bigger."

The model outputs a calibrated probability between 0 and 1 — when it says a shot has 0.20 xG, shots with those characteristics score roughly 20% of the time. I evaluated it with ROC-AUC and a calibration curve rather than accuracy, because accuracy is misleading when only 10% of shots are goals.\"*"
